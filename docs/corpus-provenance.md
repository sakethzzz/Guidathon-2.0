# GUIDATHON RAG starter corpus

The current client-side starter corpus is a small, cited set of public hackathon guidance sources. It is intentionally not described as a complete scrape of every hackathon ever held. The UI labels the records as public-source starter data and keeps user uploads separate until they pass the local intake step.

## Sources and chunking

Devpost’s “Step 8: Setting up judging” was read on 2026-10-26. Two chunks are represented in the app under `chunk://devpost-judging/001` and `chunk://devpost-judging/002`. They cover the offline/online judging distinction, organizer-defined 1–5 criteria, judge comments, submission review states, and explicit start/finish controls.

MLH’s current `member-event-guidelines.md` was read on 2026-10-26. Two chunks are represented in the app under `chunk://mlh-member-events/001` and `chunk://mlh-member-events/002`. They cover the 24–48 hour weekend event shape, end-of-event judging/prize timing, free attendance, student participation, no early elimination rounds, and permission for hackers to use generative AI and LLMs.

## Retrieval behavior

The static Preview uses a transparent token-overlap retriever so users can inspect ranking before the synthesis. Each result exposes a stable chunk ID, source label, passage, match score, and provenance. A future server-side adapter can replace this function with embeddings, a database-backed chunk store, or MCP tools without changing the visible handoff contract.

The next ingestion slice should add a server-side fetch/parse queue with robots.txt and rate-limit compliance, content hashing, heading-aware chunking, source snapshots, and explicit review states. The UI should never promote an unverified scrape to grounded evidence without a successful fetch and parse result.


## Expanded agent playbook (2026-11-08)

The hackathon starter pack now includes additional concise chunks for idea validation, security, and accessibility:

- Devpost judging and public voting: common idea-quality, implementation, and impact criteria; organizers may customize the actual rubric. https://help.devpost.com/article/64-judging-public-voting
- Google Design Sprint Kit: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, Validate; methods can be shortened when the goal and test remain clear. https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology
- OWASP Top 10:2025: awareness checklist spanning access control, configuration, supply chain, cryptography, injection, insecure design, authentication, integrity, logging, and exception handling. https://top10.owasp.org/2025/en/
- W3C WAI WCAG overview: stable accessibility standards; accessible interaction and perceivable interface states should be considered during design and testing. https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

These are a compact seed corpus, not a trained/fine-tuned model and not an exhaustive hackathon knowledge base. Athena receives the same evidence pack when useful, but her reasoning is governed by her own role prompt and validation framework.
